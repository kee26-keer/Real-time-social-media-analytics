# Real-Time Social Media Analytics Pipeline

## Overview

The **Real-Time Social Media Analytics Pipeline** is a robust system designed to process and analyze real-time social media data (e.g., tweets) for insights such as sentiment analysis. This project leverages distributed data processing tools like **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Spark** to handle large-scale data streams and machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Collects real-time tweets using the Twitter API.
- **Distributed Streaming**: Uses Kafka for fault-tolerant, scalable message handling.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes tweets to classify them as `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for horizontal scalability with Kafka and Spark.
- **Customizable Analytics**: Easily extendable to include additional text analytics (e.g., topic modeling or keyword extraction).

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Data Producer**:
   - Collects tweets via the Twitter API and sends them to Kafka.
2. **Kafka Broker**:
   - Manages distributed messaging and ensures fault-tolerant ingestion.
3. **Spark Processor**:
   - Consumes data from Kafka, processes it in real-time, and performs sentiment analysis using a pre-trained machine learning model.
4. **Storage (Optional)**:
   - Processed data can be stored in databases or displayed in dashboards.
